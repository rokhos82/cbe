# Battle Engine Custom Crit table                     version  2002.12.06
#
# Lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are ignored by the program.
#
# This file contains all the tables used for regular and custom critical
# hits.  This includes unit crits (normal ships, buildings, etc.) and
# special effects weapons (dis, heat, etc.)
#
# Each table is broken up into four comma delimited fields:
#
# table_ID   All tables with the same ID number are lumped together.
#            Currently, the BE supports up to 99 tables.
#
# weight     The total weight of a table determines the number of faces
#            that the die has.  If there are six entries with a weight
#            of one each, this is the same as a six sided die with labels
#            on each face.  The BE supports unusual dice types and bell
#            curves as well.  A table with a total weight of 7 will use
#            a 7 sided 'die' internally.  Variable weights can be used
#            to create weighted results.
#
#            Example of a 2d6 bell curve for table 13:
#
#            13,1,0,"You rolled a 2."
#            13,2,0,"You rolled a 3."
#            13,3,0,"You rolled a 4."
#            13,4,0,"You rolled a 5."
#            13,5,0,"You rolled a 6."
#            13,6,0,"You rolled a 7."
#            13,5,0,"You rolled a 8."
#            13,4,0,"You rolled a 9."
#            13,3,0,"You rolled a 10."
#            13,2,0,"You rolled a 11."
#            13,1,0,"You rolled a 12."
#
# crit_ID    Some entries have special effects on a unit.  A value of
#            zero means no special effect.  One to ten causes additional
#            damage.  Eleven to 99 are flags used to trigger special
#            code in the battle engine.  One hundred is for unit kills.
#
# text       The actual message that is displayed.  If you're adding
#            special weapons, the current style is to preface the
#            damage description with a weapon 'tag'.
